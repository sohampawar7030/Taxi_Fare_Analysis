# Taxi_Fare_Analysis
The Taxi Fare Analysis Project, offered by Yhills Educate, is a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at understanding and predicting taxi fares in urban areas. The project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about taxi rides, including pickup and drop-off locations, distance traveled, time of day, and fare amounts.

# Objectives:

# Data Collection: 
Gather a diverse dataset of taxi ride records from various sources, ensuring data quality and completeness.
# Data Preprocessing: 
Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform feature engineering to extract relevant information from raw data.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of taxi fares, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables.
# Feature Selection:
Select important features that are likely to influence taxi fares, such as distance traveled, time of day, and geographic location.
# Model Development:
Implement machine learning models, such as regression or ensemble methods, to predict taxi fares based on the selected features.
# Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).
# Interpretation and Insights:
Interpret the results of the predictive models to understand the factors driving taxi fares in urban areas. Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings.
# Documentation: 
Document the entire process, including data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, in a clear and organized manner.
# Presentation:
Create visualizations and presentations to effectively communicate the findings and methodology to a diverse audience.

# Technologies Used:

Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.
This project offers valuable insights into the factors influencing taxi fares in urban areas and provides a practical application of data analysis and machine learning techniques. It serves as a valuable learning experience for individuals interested in data science and transportation analytics.
